# Introduction
This repo is a starter project to dabble in R. It takes in population and HDI data and attempts to find correlations between them.

# Motivation
R is a pretty cool language and in order to get some hands on experience, I worked on this project. Bubble charts are something I've loved ever since I saw them on TED talks, thus my first project in R, had to involve their usage.

# Libraries
- ggplot2
- dplyr
- plotly
